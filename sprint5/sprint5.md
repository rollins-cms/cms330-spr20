# Sprint 5: File Systems and Networking

# Roadmap:
* Teams:
* Sprint Duration: Until Tu. 4/28 (last day of class)
* Quiz date/time: Tu. 4/28 - Wed. 4/29
* Requirements due: Tu. 4/28

# Rationale: 
In Sprint 5 we'll cover file systems which demonstrate a fundamental property of operating systems: persistence.  Think about how horrible it would be if data did not persist on our systems!  If data did not persist, we wouldn't be able to save our files and retrieve them when we needed them again.  If fact, we would have to reload our operating system each time we wanted to use our computer.  (In fact, this is exactly what you had to do in the early days of computers.)  We'll do a deep dive into how the operating system organizes all your files on the hardware (solid state drives or hard disk drives).  What happens when you create a directory/folder?  What happens when you move a file from your Desktop to a folder?  By the end of this sprint, you'll have an understanding of the inner workings of file systems.
