# Lab - Concurrency

## Introduction
This is a short lab to let you practice writing a program with multiple threads and then use semaphores to synchronize access to some shared resources.

In order to use threads you need to `#include <pthread.h>` at the start of your program and you need to link in the `pthread` library when you compile your program:
```
prompt$ > gcc -Wall -Werror -o threads1 threads1.c -lpthread
```

## Execution of Threads
Let's write a basic program that creates some threads.  Open a file named `threads1.c` and enter the following code:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <pthread.h>

#define NUM_THREADS 99


// Print the thread's input id argument
void * print_thread_id (void *arg) {
    long id = (long) arg;
    printf("I'm thread %ld!\n", id);
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    // Declare an array of threads
    pthread_t threads[NUM_THREADS];

    // Create those threads!
    long i;
    for (i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++) {
        pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, print_thread_id, (void *) i);
    }

    // Use pthread_join to make the main thread pause
    for (i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++) {
        pthread_join(threads[i], NULL);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Run this program **a few** times.  Remember, we're working with non-deterministic programs now, so it's important to not take a single run as the definitive answer.

Then answer the following questions:
* **Question 0: (warmup)** How many threads does this program create when it runs?
* **Question 1:** When the program runs, does it print the numbers from 0 to 98 in order?
* **Question 2:** What does the output (from multiple runs of the program) tell you about the relationship between when threads are created and when they actually run?

Look at the fourth argument to `pthread_create`. It takes the value of `i` and casts it to the generic pointer type `void *`. This is okay: it's just a way to move the value of `i` into the `print_thread_id` function while going through the required `void *` type.

## Driving the Point Home
Modify the thread creation loop (1st loop) in `main` and add another print statement after the call to `pthread_create`:

```
  for (i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++) {
    pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, print_thread_id, (void*) i);
    printf("Parent process created thread %ld\n", i);
  }
```

Compile your code again, and run it several times.  Observe when threads are created vs. when they are run.  There is **a lot** of variability in the results.

## Importance of Join
Comment out the loop in `main` which calls `pthread_join` (2nd loop).

Run your code several times and observe the results.

* **Question 3:** What is the highest thread ID created by the parent?
* **Question 4:** What is the highest thread ID you see printed from the `print_thread_id` function with the `Hi, I'm thread X!` output?
* **Question 5:** Based on your answers to the previous two questions, speculate on what happens to threads when the parent process finishes and terminates.

Once you have finished answering the above questions and testing, uncomment the `join` calls because, as we've just proved, those are kind of important. 

Re-compile and make sure you're back to "normal" (well, nondeterministic normal) before proceeding.

## Pointers and References
Now let's pass a variable by reference and see what happens!

Make 2 changes:
1. In `main`, edit the line
```
pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, print_thread_id, (void *) i);
```
to be:
```
pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, print_thread_id, &i);
```

2. In the `print_thread_id` function, edit the line:
```
    long id = (long) arg;
```
to be:
```
long id = * ((long *) arg);  // In print_thread_id
```

Compile and re-run the program several times; observe what happens:

* **Question 5:** Remember that when we pass a variable by reference, we pass its address rather than its literal value.  Think about how this code is now passing the value of `i` by reference rather than by value. Be sure to note the use of the reference `&` operator and de-reference `*` operator.
* **Question 6:** Since you are now passing `i` by reference, label each of the following statements as true or false:
   * `i` is now a shared resource among all threads
   * `i` is a local variable and thus allocated to each thread's individual stack
   * the address of `i` is a shared resource among all threads
   * the address of `i` is a local variable which is allocated on each thread's individual stack

## Locks
Now let's work on another program and see how to use locks to protect shared data/resources.

Open a program named `threads2.c` and enter the code below.

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <pthread.h>

volatile int value;  // Shared global

#define NUM_ITERATIONS 1000000

void * increment(void *arg) {
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < NUM_ITERATIONS; i++) {
        value++;
    }
    return NULL;
}

void * decrement(void *arg) {
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < NUM_ITERATIONS; i++) {
        value--;
    }
    return NULL;
}

int main() {

    pthread_t incrementer, decrementer;

    pthread_create(&incrementer, NULL, increment, NULL);
    pthread_create(&decrementer, NULL, decrement, NULL);
    
    pthread_join(incrementer, NULL);
    pthread_join(decrementer, NULL);

    printf("value = %d\n", value);
    return 0;
}
```

The first thread runs a function that **increments** a shared global variable (`value`) in a loop. The second should run a function that **decrements** the same shared global variable in a loop. When we print the value of the variable at the end of `main` after both threads have finished, it should be 0.  But this is a non-deterministic program!

Compile and run the program several times.  Make sure you understand what is happening.

* **Question 7:** Identify all the critical sections in the above program.

## Fix It
* **Question 8:** Add code which uses a semaphore called `mutex` to `threads2.c` which protects the critical region code. The relevant pieces of code are:
```
#include <semaphore.h>  //include C's semaphore library
sem_t mutex;  // declare global mutex variable which all threads can use
sem_init(&mutex, 0, 1); //initialize the semaphore mutex to be shared between threads (that's the 0 for the second argument) with a value of 1 (last argument).  
sem_wait(&mutex); // Same as P(mutex)
sem_post(&mutex); // Same as V(mutex)
sem_destroy(&mutex); //cleans up and frees memory associated with semaphore
```
You only need one semaphore (one per shared resource as a general rule of thumb).  Also, try to minimize the number of statements which are locked.  If you lock too much code, you essentially reduce your program to a single-threaded program -- NOT the goal!  The goal is to utilize the power of threads while being careful to avoid race conditions.
